preference_dist_se,Changed distance to odour,,E,PREF,"The distance of an animal from the odour source at the end of the track minus the distance at the beginning of the track. Positive values indicate the larva ends closer to the odour than it started, negative values that it ends further away."
distance_to_odor_mean,Distance to odour source,mm,E,PREF,The average distance of an animal from the odour source.
