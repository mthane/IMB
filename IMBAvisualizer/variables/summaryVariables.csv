A value of 1 indicates the animal is directly at the odour source, a value of -1 indicates it is at the maximal distance from the odour source, and a value of 0 indicates it is at the half-maximal distance from the odour source."
ratio_towards,Time ratio towards odour source,,E,PREF,"The proportion of time a larva spent oriented towards the odour source, that is, with an absolute bearing angle < 90Â°."
ratio_towards_y,Time ratio upwards,,E,PREF,The proportion of time a larva spent oriented upwards the Petri dish (that is with an absolute direction relative to Y of < 45°) - the time a larva spent oriented downwards (that is with an absolute direction relative to Y of > 135°).
odor_speed,Velocity towards odour source,mm/s,E,PREF,"The velocity of the larva's midpoint in direction of the odour. Positive values indicate that the animal is moving toward the odour, negative values that the animal is moving away."
preference_dist_se,Changed distance to odour,,E,PREF,"The distance of an animal from the odour source at the end of the track minus the distance at the beginning of the track. Positive values indicate the larva ends closer to the odour than it started, negative values that it ends further away."
distance_to_odor_mean,Distance to odour source,mm,E,PREF,The average distance of an animal from the odour source.
